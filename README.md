### @InstaDeep @BioNTech

> [!NOTE]
> I am hiring [data scientist](https://www.instadeep.com/job-offer/7212d1ab-c33e-45f6-ab2e-182c22539217/) with bioinformatics background to design proteins through lab experiments ðŸ§ª

I am a senior research engineer from the Department of BioAI at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) ([now part of BioNTech](https://www.instadeep.com/2023/07/biontech-completes-acquisition-of-instadeep/)), currently managing multiple R&D teams for bioinformatics projects.

### @UCL

> [!NOTE]
> I will give a talk about "A Recycling Training Strategy for Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Denoising Models"([paper](https://www.melba-journal.org/papers/2023:016.html), [code](https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg)) at [machine learning for biomedical imaging journal (MELBA) symposium](https://www.melba-journal.org/symposium.html).

I am also a PhD student and [Honorary Research Assistant](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/76116-yunguan-fu) from the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) at University College London, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Yipeng Hu](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5178-yipeng-hu). My research interests focus on deep learning in medical imaging. More about my research can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8Uicv-gAAAAJ&hl=en).
