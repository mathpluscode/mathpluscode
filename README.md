> I was invited to give a flash talk at the [Hinxton Immunogenomics Day](https://sites.google.com/view/hinxton-immunogenomics-2024/) on "FrameDiPT: SE(3) Diffusion Model for Protein Structure Inpainting" ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568057v2), [code](https://github.com/instadeepai/FrameDiPT)).

I am a staff research engineer from the Department of BioAI at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) ([now part of BioNTech](https://www.instadeep.com/2023/07/biontech-completes-acquisition-of-instadeep/)), currently managing multiple R&D teams for bioinformatics projects.

### @UCL

> [!NOTE]
> I was invited to give a talk at the [MELBA Symposium](https://www.melba-journal.org/symposium.html) on "A Recycling Training Strategy for Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Denoising Models" ([slides](https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg/blob/main/MELBA_Symposium_2024.pdf), [paper](https://www.melba-journal.org/papers/2023:016.html), [code](https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg)).

I am also a PhD student and [Honorary Research Assistant](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/76116-yunguan-fu) from the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) at University College London, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Yipeng Hu](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5178-yipeng-hu). My research interests focus on deep learning in medical imaging. More about my research can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8Uicv-gAAAAJ&hl=en).
