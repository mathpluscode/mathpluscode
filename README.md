### Hi, I'm Yunguan ðŸ‘‹

#### @InstaDeep @BioNTech

> :star2: We have two papers [LightMHC: A Light Model for pMHC Structure Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568015v1) and [FrameDiPT: SE(3) Diffusion Model for Protein Structure Inpainting](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.21.568057v1) being accepted at [NeurIPS 2023 Machine Learning in Structural Biology Workshop](https://www.mlsb.io/)!

I am a senior research engineer from the Department of BioAI at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) ([now part of BioNTech](https://www.instadeep.com/2023/07/biontech-completes-acquisition-of-instadeep/)), currently managing multiple R&D teams for bioinformatics projects. In particular, we are monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with the [Early Warning System](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523000835). I am currently hiring [(senior) research engineers](https://www.instadeep.com/job-offer/8c0fb936-61b0-4569-acbf-cfefa05c3a61/) and [ML software engineers](https://www.instadeep.com/job-offer/d94bd2e9-5862-4af0-9568-c97d6265a741/).

> :raised_hands: Our new paper [A Recycling Training Strategy for Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Denoising Models](https://www.melba-journal.org/papers/2023:016.html) has been published in [machine learning for biomedical imaging journal (MELBA)](https://www.melba-journal.org/) and the JAX/FLAX-based code base is available at [ImgX-DiffSeg](https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg)!

I am also a PhD student and [Honorary Research Assistant](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/76116-yunguan-fu) from the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) at University College London, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Yipeng Hu](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5178-yipeng-hu). My research interests focus on deep learning in medical imaging. More about my research can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8Uicv-gAAAAJ&hl=en).
