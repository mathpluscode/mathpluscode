> :tada: Our paper [Progressive loss of conserved spike protein neutralizing antibody sites in Omicron sublineages is balanced by preserved T cell immunity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112888) is now published in Cell Reports journal!

I am a senior research engineer from the Department of BioAI at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) ([now part of BioNTech](https://www.instadeep.com/2023/07/biontech-completes-acquisition-of-instadeep/)), currently managing multiple R&D teams for bioinformatics projects.
In particular, we are monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with the Early Warning System ([Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.24.474095v2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523000835))).

> :bookmark_tabs: Our new paper [A Recycling Training Strategy for Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Denoising Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16355) has been released and the JAX-based code base is available at [ImgX-DiffSeg](https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg)! This is the follow-up paper to [Importance of Aligning Training Strategy with Evaluation for Diffusion Models in 3D Multiclass Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06040), which has been accepted at [Deep Generative Models workshop @ MICCAI 2023](https://dgm4miccai.github.io/) and the code base is available at [ImgX-DiffSeg v0.1.0](https://github.com/mathpluscode/ImgX-DiffSeg/tree/v0.1.0)!

I am also a PhD student and [Honorary Research Assistant](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/76116-yunguan-fu) from the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) at University College London, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Yipeng Hu](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5178-yipeng-hu). My research interests focus on deep learning in medical imaging. More about my research can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8Uicv-gAAAAJ&hl=en).
