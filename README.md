### Hi, I'm Yunguan ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior research engineer at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), currently managing multiple R&D teams for bioinformatics projects at BioAI department in collaboration with [BioNTech](https://www.biontech.com).
In particular, we are monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with the Early Warning System ([Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.24.474095v2), [InstaDeep announcement](https://www.instadeep.com/2022/01/biontech-and-instadeep-developed-and-successfully-tested-early-warning-system-to-detect-potential-high-risk-sars-cov-2-variants/), [BioNTech announcement](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-and-instadeep-developed-and-successfully-tested-early)).
**I am actively hiring [Senior Research Engineer](https://instadeep.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=253), [Research Engineer](https://instadeep.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=267), and [Computational Biologist](https://instadeep.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=262) in London.**

I am also a PhD student in the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) at University College London, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Yipeng Hu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=YHUXX66). My research interests focus on geometric deep learning in medical imaging. More about my research can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8Uicv-gAAAAJ&hl=en).
