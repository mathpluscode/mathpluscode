### Hi, I'm Yunguan ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior research engineer from the Department of BioAI at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) ([now part of BioNTech](https://www.instadeep.com/2023/07/biontech-completes-acquisition-of-instadeep/)), currently managing multiple R&D teams for bioinformatics projects.
In particular, we are monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with the Early Warning System ([Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.24.474095v2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523000835))).

I am also a PhD student and [Honorary Research Assistant](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/people/honorary-staff) from the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) at University College London, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Yipeng Hu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=YHUXX66). My research interests focus on geometric deep learning in medical imaging. More about my research can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8Uicv-gAAAAJ&hl=en).
